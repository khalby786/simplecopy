# simplecopy
This is a library I made to just perform the bare minimum functionality for copying to the clipboard using JavaScript. Actually, it's less of a library and more of just one function. I minified it by hand to make it as small as possible and also because I was bored. It's about 350 bytes minified and gzipped.

## Demo:
Coming soon. For now just download the demo.html file.

## How to Use:
1. Download and import it with `<script src="simplecopy.min.js"></script>` or use the CDN link `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/kyle-rb/simplecopy/simplecopy.min.js"></script>`.
   - Or, just copy it into a script tag or another JavaScript source file.
2. Call `simplecopy("<your text here>")` from anywhere. (Note: this has to be triggered by a user action because of browser restrictions on copying.)
3. You're done.

## Compatibility:
This works in Chrome and Firefox on Mac, Windows, and Android, as well as Edge on Windows (and probably some versions of IE). It works in newer versions of Safari, I think version 10 or 11 and up. I'm not 100% sure about anything on iOS. The `simplecopy` function returns `false` if it fails to execute properly.
